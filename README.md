# About Example

The Basic example shows how one would install DID and get it running locally in your machine ready for production.

It is shown how you would install did-examples package and use the key modules in the did-examples to achieve registration and authentication in your project.

It demonstrates the usage of DID for Sign-up, Sign-in, Recovery of an Account within a frontend React application.

The SignInForm and SignUpForm component, are ready-made form flows, using ReactJS, and provided
by us to integrate into your applications.

To rapidly build or prototype your rich decentralized applications. In cases where the application using the DID needs to implement more advanced functionalities it can use the low-level API (Core API), though using the ready-made flows should be
sufficient for most application developers.
